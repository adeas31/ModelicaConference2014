Since the 2010 conference, LMS considerably increased its effort to make Imagine.Lab the best-of-breed platform for system simulation.
LMS’ will is to deliver a combined structured approach (C-based and Modelica-based) to best serve the engineering needs, from full system to detailed component modeling over most of the mechatronics applications.
LMS continues to support the establishment of Modelica as an industrial reference through its dedicated commercial support team as well as its involvement in European research projects and its support of the FMI.
LMS’s position in the Model Based System Engineering software market is considerably increasing to the benefit of the industry and the recognition of Modelica.

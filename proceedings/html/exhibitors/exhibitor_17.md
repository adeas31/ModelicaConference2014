Founded by Stephen Wolfram in 1987, Wolfram is one of the world's most respected software companies.
At the center is Mathematica: the world's most powerful global computation system. In 2011, Wolfram acquired MathCore Engineering AB - a founding member of the Modelica Association and an active influence in the Modelica language design since 1997.
Through this, SystemModeler was released in 2012 - the most complete physical modeling and simulation tool.
Unlike other systems, SystemModeler requires no add-ons, supports the standard Modelica model language and is designed to connect perfectly with Mathematica for the ultimate integrated modeling, simulation, and analysis workflow.

Claytex is an engineering consultancy and software distributor that specialises in Systems Engineering.
Our expertise is in the modelling and simulation of complex multi-domain systems using Dymola and Modelica.
We are based in Leamington Spa (UK) and work with Modelica and FMI on a wide variety of projects.
Most recently these include the modelling of Low Carbon Vehicles, Formula 1 and Nascar Sprint Cup racing cars.
These projects apply the models in a wide range of tasks including energy usage calculations, control system development, powertrain design and driving simulators.
We develop a number of application libraries for Dymola include the Engines, Powertrain Dynamics, SystemID, FlexBody, VDLMotorsports and XMLReader libraries.

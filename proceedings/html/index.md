<h2>Proceedings</h2>
<p>The 10th International Modelica Conference is the main event for our community. Users, library developers, tool vendors, and language designers will gather to share their knowledge and learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to Modelica and FMI (Functional Mockup Interface).</p>

<p>This 10th milestone conference returns to Lund, where the first event took place in 2000. Since then, Modelica has matured from an idea among a small number of dedicated enthusiasts to a widely accepted standard language for the modeling and simulation of cyber-physical systems. Modelica is now used in many industries including automotive, energy and process, aerospace, and industrial equipment. Modelica has even been tapped for one-of-a-kind systems engineering designs such as the ESS (European Spallation Source) which is currently being built nearby in Lund. Modelica is the language of choice for modeling and simulation of complex system interactions.</p>
 
<p>The addition of the FMI standard to the project portfolio under the stewardship of the Modelica Association has greatly strengthened Modelica. FMI provides a complementary standard that enables deployment of high quality models to a larger number of engineers working with system design and verification. </p>

<p>Conference highlights: 
<ul>
    <li>2 Keynote speeches</li>
    <li>114 papers in 5 parallel tracks</li>
    <li>23 posters</li>
    <li>6 tutorials</li>
    <li>5 libraries for the Modelica Library Award</li>
    <li>6 vendor sessions presenting the latest Modelica and FMI tools</li>
    <li>A fully booked exhibition area featuring 18 exhibitors</li>
    <li>Electronic proceedings including all papers and some associated Modelica libraries and models</li>
</ul>

<p>The conference also presents new initiatives from the Modelica Association. Since the last conference, there has been a major effort to improve the standards compliance process for the Modelica language, the Modelica Libraries developed by the Modelica association, and the FMI standard.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The latest Modelica Standard Library release (MSL 3.2.1) has been enhanced and modified to be fully compliant with the Modelica Language Standards version 3.2 rev2, and is now solely based on open source code under the Modelica License version 2.0.</li>
    <li>MSL 3.2.1 has also been improved to significantly simplify comparisons of simulations of the same model across multiple Modelica environments. Tools to support such comparisons are now available through the Modelica Association. </li>
    <li>The Modelica language version 3.2rev 2 fixed many ambiguities in the specification. </li>
    <li>A Modelica Compliance Test Library has been carefully designed and implemented to verify that a Modelica tool is compliant to the Modelica specification. It has been tested with many tools, with agreed-upon reference results.</li>
    <li>A set of FMI Cross Check Rules was established in July 2013 and has been used by many vendors to verify tool quality and interoperability. All results are publically presented in a dynamic, online, tabular reference.</li>
</ul>

<p>These combined efforts have helped to increase the industrial acceptance, commitment to, and use of Modelica and FMI as central standards for analytic model based systems engineering. </p>

<p>Finally, we want to acknowledge the support we received from the program board and program committee. Special thanks to this year’s organizers, the Modelica Association, Modelon AB, and Amelie Rönngård from Anagram. Last but not least, let us thank all authors for their contributions to this conference.</p>

<p>We wish all participants an enjoyable and successful conference.</p>

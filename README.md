The 10th International Modelica Conference will be held at the Lund University Campus in Lund, Sweden on March 10 - 12, 2014. It is organized by the [Modelica Association](https://modelica.org) and [Modelon](http://www.modelon.com/)

The Modelica Conference is the main event for users, library developers, tool vendors and language designers to share their knowledge and learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to [Modelica](https://modelica.org) and to the [Functional Mockup Interface](http://www.fmi-standard.org/). The program will cover modeling of complex physical and cyber-physical systems, as well as tools, for a wide range of research and industrial applications. All contributions are peer-reviewed and selected by the Program Committee. In addition to traditional paper presentations and poster sessions, the conference features several Modelica tutorials for beginners and advanced users, as well as vendor presentations, and an exhibition. The last Modelica conference in 2012 was visited by 350 participants from all over the world, and we expect a similar size at this conference.

We are looking forward to seeing you in _Lund_.

_Dr. Hubertus Tummescheit and Prof. Karl-Erik Årzén_

# Conference Venue

The meeting will take place at Matteannexet / Matematikcentrum, the Center of Mathematical Sciences located in the centre of Lund, approximately 15 minutes walking distance from Lund Central Station.

Opening and closing ceremony is held at Kårhuset (across the street from the conference venue Center of Mathematical Sciences).

# Exhibition and Sponsoring

A [commercial exhibition](sponsors.md) will be arranged in conjunction to the conference. The exhibition will take place at Matteannexet at Lund University. The commercial exhibition will be integrated with the session halls, poster exhibition and the catering services and will thus be an excellent exhibition window towards the expected 300-400 delegates.

The exhibition will be open during conference hours, 11-12 March 2014. Build-up will take place 10 March from 07.00. Please note that heavy goods can only be delivered between 07.00-08.00 in the morning or 13.00-14.00 in the afternoon due to exams in the building. Therefore no noise is possible outside these hours.

The program structure will make time for the participants to visit your stand. This means that there are excellent opportunities for dialogue between exhibitors and conference participants.

# Keynote Speeches

## Dr. Hilding Elmqvist, CTO Systems, Dassault Systèmes

Elmqvist’s Ph.D. thesis in 1978 from the Department of Automatic Control, Lund Institute of Technology contains the design of a novel object-oriented and equation based modelling language, Dymola, and algorithms for symbolic model manipulation. In 1992, Elmqvist founded Dynasim AB (since 2006 part of Dassault Systèmes) and in 1996 he took the initiative to organize the international effort to design the next generation object-oriented language for physical modelling, Modelica. Elmqvist is the chief architect of the Multi-Engineering Modelling and Simulation software for Modelica used in Dymola Product Line and CATIA Systems DBM. He is also responsible for Technology within the board of Modelica Association.

### Modelica Evolution - From My Perspective

This paper intends to tell the story of [Modelica](https://www.modelica.org) from the author's perspective. It is a fantastic saga that for me started in April 1976. The saga includes studying the needs, the original idea, the development of a solution, waiting for mature hardware technology, a start-up company, a fantastic collaboration, an automotive company caring for its software supplier, how to get momentum by standards collaboration, forming the right team, and the magic phone call from the right company.

## Dr. Clas Jacobson Chief Scientist, United Technologies Systems & Controls Engineering

Dr. Jacobson is Chief Scientist for the United Technologies Systems & Controls Engineering (UTSCE) organization. In this role he works with the UTC business units to ensure capability in systems engineering and controls is available for product development. Prior to his role as Chief Scientist for UTSCE he worked as the Chief Scientist, Controls for UTC and before that at the United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) in management and technical positions since 1995. Dr. Jacobson received his Ph.D degree in electrical engineering in 1986 from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He was an Associate Professor at Northeastern University in Boston from 1986-1995.

### Modelica: Systems Engineering, Technology Readiness, & Industrial Opportunities

The talk focuses on systems engineering in the industrial context. Systems engineering means analytical and in the context of product development. Four elements characterize systems engineering: (1) requirements, (2) architecture, (3) model based development and (4) design flows. Lessons learned from using Modelica in several industrial case studies will be reviewed. Industrial needs will be presented for wider & deeper deployment of Modelica.
